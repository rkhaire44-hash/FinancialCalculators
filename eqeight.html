        <p>How investors deploy capital into equities, the vehicles they use, and the strategies they follow.</p>

    <main class="content-container">

        <button class="accordion">1. Mutual Funds / Open-End Funds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A mutual fund (or open-end fund) is a pooled investment vehicle that collects money from many investors and invests it in a diversified portfolio of stocks. "Open-end" means the fund issues and redeems shares on demand based on its Net Asset Value (NAV).</p>
            <p><strong>NAV = (Total Value of Portfolio – Liabilities) / Shares Outstanding</strong></p>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Investors buy or redeem shares directly from the fund company, not from other investors. Shares are priced once per day at NAV, which is calculated after the market closes. A fund manager actively manages the portfolio based on a specific investment mandate.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>An investor buys $10,000 worth of the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund. They receive shares at that day's closing NAV (e.g., $50/share = 200 shares). If the NAV rises to $55, their investment value becomes $11,000.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Index Funds & ETFs</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Index Funds</h4>
            <p>These are passive funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market index, like the S&P 500. They are low-cost, have low turnover, and their NAV is calculated daily like a mutual fund. An example is the Vanguard 500 Index Fund.</p>
            
            <h4>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h4>
            <p>ETFs are typically index-tracking funds that are traded on stock exchanges, just like individual stocks. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold intraday at market prices.</p>
            
            <h4>ETF Creation/Redemption Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Authorized Participants (APs) keep the ETF's market price aligned with its NAV through an arbitrage process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Creation:</strong> APs deliver a basket of the underlying securities to the ETF issuer in exchange for new ETF shares.</li>
                <li><strong>Redemption:</strong> APs return ETF shares to the issuer in exchange for the underlying securities.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If an ETF trades above its NAV, APs will sell the ETF and buy the underlying stocks, pushing the ETF price down. If it trades below NAV, they do the opposite.</p>
            <p><strong>Tracking Error:</strong> This is the small difference between an ETF's returns and its underlying index's returns, caused by fees, cash drag, or sampling methods.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Hedge Funds</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Hedge funds are private, actively managed investment vehicles for accredited or institutional investors. They aim for absolute returns using flexible strategies like leverage, short selling, and derivatives. They typically charge "2 and 20" fees (2% management fee, 20% performance fee).</p>

        <button class="accordion">4. Pension Funds & Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>These are large, long-term institutional investors managing public or corporate retirement assets (pension funds) or state reserves (SWFs). They focus on capital preservation, steady growth, and income over extremely long horizons.</p>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pension Fund:</strong> CalPERS (California Public Employees’ Retirement System).</li>
                <li><strong>SWF:</strong> Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global.</li>
            </ul>
             <h4>Role of Equity</h4>
             <p>Equities serve as the primary long-term growth driver in their asset allocation, often making up 40–70% of the portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5. Private Equity (PE) & Venture Capital (VC)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Private equity involves investing in non-public companies or taking public companies private with the goal of improving operations and selling them for a profit later. These are long-term (5–10 years), illiquid, high-risk, and high-return investments.</p>
