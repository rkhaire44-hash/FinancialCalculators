        <button class="accordion">1. SPAC Mechanics & Sponsor Economics</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) is a “blank check” company formed to raise capital via an IPO with the purpose of acquiring or merging with a private company, effectively taking it public without a traditional IPO.</p>
            <h4>Mechanics Step-by-Step</h4>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Stage</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td><strong>1. Formation</strong></td><td>A sponsor (investment firm or executives) forms a shell company, typically capitalized with ~$5–10 million.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>2. IPO</strong></td><td>The SPAC raises funds (e.g., $300M) by issuing units (1 share + fraction of a warrant). IPO proceeds go into a trust account.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>3. Search Period</strong></td><td>The sponsor has 18–24 months to identify a target private company for acquisition.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>4. Announcement & Vote</strong></td><td>The SPAC announces a target, and shareholders vote on the “de-SPAC” transaction. Investors can redeem their shares for cash if they disapprove.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>5. PIPE Financing</strong></td><td>To supplement redemptions, the sponsor often raises a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) from institutions.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>6. De-SPAC (Merger)</strong></td><td>Upon approval, the SPAC merges with the target, which becomes a publicly listed company.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>7. Post-merger Trading</strong></td><td>The new entity trades under the target’s name; warrants often separate and trade independently.</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h4>Sponsor Economics</h4>
            <p>Sponsors typically receive “promote” shares, equal to 20% of the post-IPO equity, for a nominal cost. This high-risk, high-reward structure can lead to misalignment if sponsors are incentivized to close any deal before their deadline.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Convertible Arbitrage & Capital Structure Arbitrage</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Convertible Arbitrage</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A market-neutral hedge fund strategy involving a long position in a convertible bond and a short position in the underlying equity to exploit pricing inefficiencies.</p>
            <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The trader buys the convertible bond (for its cheap optionality) and shorts the underlying stock (to hedge equity exposure). Profits are generated from mispricing, changes in volatility, or credit spread movements, not from the stock's direction.</p>
            
            <h4>Capital Structure Arbitrage</h4>
            <p>A broader strategy that trades on mispricings between different securities of the same company (e.g., shorting bonds while going long the equity if credit risk seems overpriced relative to the stock).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Equity-Linked Credit Events (M&A Arbitrage)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Also known as Merger Arbitrage or Risk Arbitrage, this strategy involves traders profiting from the spread between a target stock's price and the announced takeover price.</p>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Company A announces it will acquire Company B for $100 per share.</li>
                <li>Company B’s stock, previously at $70, rises to $95. The $5 gap represents the "deal risk" (the risk the merger fails).</li>
                <li>An arbitrageur buys Company B at $95, aiming to capture the $5 spread if the deal closes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The main risk is the deal breaking due to regulatory issues, financing problems, or shareholder rejection.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Cross-Listings & Dual Listings</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-Listing:</strong> When a company’s shares are listed on more than one stock exchange (e.g., via depositary receipts like ADRs).</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Listing:</strong> Two separate legal listings with full trading status on both exchanges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Alibaba has a cross-listing on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), giving it access to a broader investor base and higher liquidity.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5. Delisting & Going-Private Transactions</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p><strong>Delisting</strong> is the removal of a company's shares from a stock exchange. A <strong>going-private transaction</strong> is when a public company is acquired (usually by management or a private equity firm) and ceases to be publicly traded.</p>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>The buyer offers a premium to the current share price, purchases all outstanding public shares for cash, and then deregisters the company with the securities regulator. The company becomes private, free from public disclosure requirements.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Dell Inc. went private in 2013 in a buyout led by Michael Dell and the private equity firm Silver Lake. It later relisted in 2018.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">6. Shareholder Litigation & Class Actions</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Investors may sue companies, directors, or officers for issues like misrepresentation, fraud, or a breach of fiduciary duty. These are often filed as class-action lawsuits on behalf of all affected shareholders.</p>
            <h4>Common Causes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accounting fraud or misleading financial statements.</li>
                <li>Misleading earnings guidance or business projections.</li>
                <li>Breaches of duty during mergers and acquisitions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Following the accounting scandals at companies like Enron and Wirecard, investors filed major class-action lawsuits to recover losses, leading to significant legal and financial consequences for the companies and their executives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">7. Employee Equity Plans & Dilution Management</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Companies use equity compensation plans to incentivize employees and align their interests with those of shareholders.</p>
            <h4>Types of Plans</h4>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td><strong>Stock Options</strong></td><td>The right to buy shares at a fixed strike price after a vesting period.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)</strong></td><td>A grant of actual shares that are delivered to the employee after they vest over time.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan)</strong></td><td>Allows employees to buy company shares at a discount, usually via payroll deductions.</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h4>Dilution</h4>
            <p>Issuing new shares for these plans reduces the ownership percentage and EPS of existing shareholders. Companies often manage this dilution by using share buybacks to repurchase shares from the market.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">8. Share Buybacks — Advanced Topics</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition & Purpose</h4>
            <p>A company repurchases its own shares from the open market to return capital to shareholders, increase EPS, or signal that management believes the stock is undervalued.</p>
            <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Buybacks can be done via open-market repurchases, fixed-price tender offers, or Accelerated Share Repurchases (ASRs) arranged with investment banks. The repurchased shares are recorded as "Treasury Stock."</p>
            <h4>EPS Accretion Example</h4>
            <p>A company with $100M in net income and 100M shares has an EPS of $1.00. If it buys back 10 million shares, the new share count is 90 million, and the EPS increases to $1.11 ($100M / 90M), an 11% boost.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Apple has spent over $600 billion on share buybacks since 2012, significantly reducing its share count and boosting its EPS.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">9. Cross-Asset Interactions</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Equity prices do not move in isolation; they are interconnected with interest rates, credit spreads, currencies, and commodities.</p>
            <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
             <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead><tr><th>Driver</th><th>Impact on Equity Valuation</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead>

                        <tr><td><strong>Interest Rates</strong></td><td>Higher rates decrease the present value of future cash flows, hurting equity valuations (especially for growth stocks).</td><td>The 2022 Fed hikes caused a sharp decline in tech valuations.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>Credit Spreads</strong></td><td>Widening spreads signal higher risk in the economy, leading to a "risk-off" sentiment that pushes equity prices down.</td><td>During the 2008 crisis, credit spreads exploded and equities crashed.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>Currency Movements</strong></td><td>A strong domestic currency hurts the earnings of multinational exporters, as their foreign revenues translate into fewer domestic dollars.</td><td>A strong USD can be a headwind for S&P 500 companies with large international sales.</td></tr>
