        <button class="accordion">1. Primary vs. Secondary Markets</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Market:</strong> Where companies issue new securities to raise capital — typically through IPOs, follow-on offerings, or private placements.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Market:</strong> Where existing securities are bought and sold among investors. The issuing company does not receive any money here.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Company issues new shares → Investors subscribe → Company receives proceeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Investor A sells shares to Investor B → Proceeds go to Investor A, not the company.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><strong>Primary:</strong> Tesla raises $2B by issuing new shares in a follow-on offering.<br>
            <strong>Secondary:</strong> You buy Tesla shares from another investor on Nasdaq — Tesla receives no new capital.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Interview Tip:</strong> Primary Market = Capital Formation. Secondary Market = Liquidity Provision.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Stock Exchanges & Alternative Trading Venues</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stock Exchange:</strong> A regulated marketplace where securities are listed and traded (e.g., NYSE, Nasdaq, LSE, BSE).</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Trading System (ATS):</strong> Non-exchange trading venues like electronic communication networks (ECNs) or dark pools.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Pools:</strong> Private venues for large trades with minimal pre-trade transparency to reduce market impact.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Exchanges match buy and sell orders based on price and time priority. ATS and dark pools are often used by institutions for block trades to avoid market impact.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A hedge fund wants to sell 5 million shares of Apple. If placed on the NYSE all at once, the large supply might push the price down. Instead, it executes the trade in a dark pool to minimize this price impact (slippage).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Order-Driven vs. Quote-Driven Markets</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Order-Driven Markets</h4>
            <p>Prices are determined by the supply and demand of buy and sell orders from the public. Orders are matched directly in a central limit order book. Examples include NYSE, LSE, and NSE.</p>
            <h4>Quote-Driven Markets</h4>
            <p>Market makers provide liquidity by quoting continuous bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices. Investors trade against these quotes. Examples include Nasdaq (historically) and OTC markets.</p>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><strong>Order-Driven:</strong> The order book shows a bid for 100 shares @ $50.00 and an ask for 200 shares @ $50.05. A market buy order would execute at $50.05.<br>
            <strong>Quote-Driven:</strong> A dealer quotes a price of $49.95 / $50.05. An investor can sell to the dealer at $49.95 or buy from the dealer at $50.05.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Interview Tip:</strong> Most major exchanges today are hybrid systems, using a central order book but also having designated market makers to ensure liquidity.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Market Makers, Liquidity Providers, & DMMs</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Makers:</strong> Financial firms that provide liquidity by continuously quoting bid and ask prices, profiting from the bid-ask spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Providers:</strong> A broader term that includes market makers, institutional investors, and algorithmic traders who add depth to the market.</li>
                <li><strong>Designated Market Makers (DMMs):</strong> Specific firms appointed by an exchange (like the NYSE) to maintain a fair and orderly market in certain stocks. They are obligated to provide liquidity during volatile periods.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A Nasdaq market maker quotes a stock at Bid: $49.90 (their buy price) and Ask: $50.10 (their sell price). The $0.20 difference is their spread. On the NYSE, a DMM for Apple ensures there are always bids and asks available, even during sharp market moves.</p>

        <button class="accordion">6. Best Execution, Order Routing & PFOF</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Execution:</strong> A regulatory requirement for brokers to execute client orders on the most favorable terms possible (considering price, speed, cost, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Order Routing:</strong> The process by which brokers use smart order routers (SORs) to send client orders to different venues (exchanges, dark pools) to achieve best execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment for Order Flow (PFOF):</strong> A practice where brokers receive compensation from market makers for routing client orders to them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>You place a market order on a retail brokerage app. The app routes your order to a large market maker like Citadel Securities. Citadel executes your trade and pays the brokerage a small fee for sending them the order flow.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">7. Off-Exchange Trading & Block Trades</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Off-Exchange Trading:</strong> Trading executed outside traditional exchanges, often through dark pools, OTC, or internalization by brokers.</li>
                <li><strong>Block Trades:</strong> Large transactions (typically over 10,000 shares) that are executed privately to avoid impacting the public market price.</li>
            </ul>
             <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Block trades are often negotiated directly between institutions or through specialized brokers. The trade is reported to the public tape after execution for transparency.</p>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A pension fund wants to sell 5 million shares. Selling on the open market would cause the price to collapse. Instead, they execute a block trade with another fund over-the-counter at a privately negotiated price.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">8. Tick Size Regimes & Price Improvement</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tick Size:</strong> The minimum price increment at which a security can trade (e.g., $0.01 for most U.S. stocks).</li>
                <li><strong>Price Improvement:</strong> Executing a trade at a better price than the current national best bid and offer (NBBO).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>The NBBO for a stock is $50.00 / $50.05. Your market buy order is filled at $50.03. You have received $0.02 of price improvement per share.</p>

                Be prepared to answer common questions like: "What’s the difference between primary and secondary markets?", "How do dark pools reduce market impact?", "Explain a market order vs. a limit order and when you’d use each.", and "How does payment for order flow work and why is it controversial?"
