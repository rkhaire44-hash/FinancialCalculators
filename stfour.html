        <button class="accordion">1. What is Custody?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Custody is the service of holding and safekeeping financial assets on behalf of an investor. A **custodian bank** (or simply, custodian) is a specialized financial institution responsible for protecting a client's securities and performing various administrative tasks related to those assets. Think of them as the "vault" and "accountant" for large-scale investors.</p>
            <h4>Who Uses Custodians?</h4>
            <p>Institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds are legally required to use custodians to protect their assets from theft or loss.</p>
            <h4>Key Global Custodians</h4>
            <p>The market is dominated by a few large players, including BNY Mellon, State Street, J.P. Morgan, and Citigroup.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Global Custodian vs. Sub-Custodian Model</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>The Network Model</h4>
            <p>For cross-border investments, custodians operate on a network model to provide global coverage.</p>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Role</th><th>Description</th><th>Responsibilities</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td><strong>Global Custodian</strong></td><td>The primary custodian that has the direct relationship with the client (e.g., an asset manager).</td><td>Consolidated reporting, client service, global oversight.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>Sub-Custodian</strong></td><td>A local bank in a foreign market, appointed by the global custodian to hold assets in that specific country.</td><td>Local settlement, regulatory compliance, corporate action processing on the ground.</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A UK-based pension fund wants to invest in the Indian stock market. They appoint BNY Mellon as their **Global Custodian**. BNY Mellon, in turn, appoints a local Indian bank like ICICI Bank as its **Sub-Custodian** in India. The shares of the Indian companies are held in an account at ICICI Bank, but BNY Mellon provides the UK fund with a single, consolidated view of all its global holdings.</p>

        <button class="accordion">3. Core Custody & Asset Servicing Functions</button>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Trade Settlement:</strong> Executing the final transfer of securities and cash on behalf of the client for all their trades.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Income Collection</h4>
            <p>Collecting all income generated by the securities, such as dividends from stocks and coupon payments from bonds, and crediting it to the client's cash account.</p>
            <h4>Corporate Action Processing</h4>
            <p>Managing all corporate actions. This includes notifying the client of the event, processing mandatory events (like stock splits), and managing elections for voluntary events (like tender offers).</p>
            <h4>Tax Services</h4>
            <p>Managing tax-related activities, including withholding tax on income payments and filing for tax reclaims based on double-taxation treaties to ensure the client receives the most favorable tax rate.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>This refers to how a custodian holds client assets at a CSD or with a sub-custodian.</p>

                        <tr><td><strong>Omnibus Account</strong></td><td>A single account where the assets of multiple clients are pooled together. The custodian maintains its own internal records to track which assets belong to which client.</td><td><strong>Pro:</strong> Cheaper and more operationally efficient. <br><strong>Con:</strong> Less transparent. In case of the custodian's insolvency, it can be more complex to separate client assets.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>Segregated Account</strong></td><td>A separate account is opened for each individual client. The client's assets are legally separated from those of other clients and the custodian itself.</td><td><strong>Pro:</strong> Highest level of asset protection and transparency. <br><strong>Con:</strong> More expensive and operationally complex to manage.</td></tr>

            <h4>Final Interview Tips</h4>
            <blockquote>Be prepared to explain the role of a global custodian and why the sub-custodian network is necessary for international investing. Articulate the key services that fall under "asset servicing," especially corporate actions and tax. Understand the trade-offs between omnibus and segregated accounts, particularly from an asset protection perspective. This knowledge is fundamental for any role in asset management, fund administration, or operations.</blockquote>
