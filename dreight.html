            <h4>A Phased Approach to Learning</h4>
            <p>This roadmap is designed to build your knowledge from the ground up. Follow these phases to ensure a strong and comprehensive understanding, regardless of your target role. While all phases are important, you can spend more time on the phase most relevant to your desired career path.</p>

        <button class="accordion">2. Phase 1: Master the Foundations (The "What")</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Priority 1: Big Picture / Basic Concepts</h4>
            <p>You must be able to explain what a derivative is, its purpose, and the fundamental differences between payoff types (linear, convex, etc.) and trading venues (Exchange vs. OTC) from memory.</p>
            <h4>Priority 2: Core Instruments</h4>
            <p>Deeply understand the mechanics of Forwards, Futures, Options, and Swaps. You should be able to draw payoff diagrams, explain who uses them and why, and walk through a simple example for each without hesitation.</p>
            <h4>Self-Test Questions for this Phase:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Explain the difference between a forward and a future."</li>
                <li>"Draw the profit/loss diagram for a short put option."</li>
                <li>"Walk me through the cash flows of a plain vanilla interest rate swap."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Phase 2: The 'Quant' Layer: Pricing & Risk (The "Why")</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Focus Area: Volatility, Surfaces, & Calibration</h4>
            <p>This is where you move from mechanics to valuation. Understanding volatility is the key to understanding derivatives pricing.</p>
            <h4>Key Concepts to Master:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implied Volatility:</strong> Know what it is and why it's important. Be able to explain the Volatility Smile/Smirk and why it exists in equity markets (crash risk, demand for puts).</li>
                <li><strong>The Greeks:</strong> You must know Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta. Be able to explain what each one measures and how it's used in hedging.</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrage Constraints:</strong> Have a high-level understanding that a vol surface must be arbitrage-free (e.g., no calendar or butterfly arbitrage).</li>
            </ul>
             <blockquote><strong>For Quant/Trading Roles:</strong> Go deeper. Understand calibration concepts, parametric models like SVI/SABR, and the difference between sticky-delta and sticky-strike conventions.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Phase 3: The 'How It Works' Layer: Market Mechanics</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This phase covers the entire ecosystem that supports derivative trading. For any operational, risk, or middle office role, this is the most critical area.</p>
            <h4>Focus Areas to Connect:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clearing, Settlement & Post-Trade:</strong> The role of a CCP, the margin waterfall, and the settlement process.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Microstructure:</strong> Order books, execution algos (VWAP/TWAP), and HFT.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations, Middle & Back Office:</strong> P&L attribution, IPV, lifecycle events, and reconciliations.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Conventions:</strong> The ISDA/CSA framework, day counts, and regulatory identifiers (LEI/UTI).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Self-Test Questions for this Phase:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Walk me through the lifecycle of a cleared OTC swap, from execution to settlement."</li>
                <li>"What is a CCP and what is its primary role in mitigating risk?"</li>
                <li>"Explain the role of the Middle Office in P&L attribution and independent price verification."</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>Tailor your deep-dive study to the role you are interviewing for. While you need a general understanding of all topics, your expertise should align with your target job.</p>

             <h4>Behavioral & Market Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prepare Your Story:</strong> Be ready to answer "Why derivatives?", "Why our firm?", and "Tell me about a time you solved a complex problem." with clear, structured examples.</li>
                <li><strong>Have a Market View:</strong> Be aware of current market trends. What are interest rates doing? What is the level of the VIX? Have an opinion on a recent market event. Read the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Brainteasers:</strong> Many firms still use logic and probability puzzles. The goal is to see your thought process, so talk through your logic out loud.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask Good Questions:</strong> Prepare insightful questions for your interviewers about their role, the desk's strategy, or the biggest challenges they face. This shows genuine interest.</li>
