        <button class="accordion">1. IPO (Initial Public Offering) – Going Public</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>An IPO is the process by which a private company offers shares to the public for the first time and lists them on a stock exchange, transforming it into a publicly traded company.</p>
            <h4>IPO Process – Step by Step</h4>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Step</th><th>Process</th><th>Key Details</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>1</td><td>Mandate & Due Diligence</td><td>Company hires investment banks (bookrunners); legal, financial, and business due diligence performed.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>2</td><td>Draft Prospectus / Registration</td><td>Filed with regulator (e.g., SEC Form S-1); includes financials, risks, use of proceeds.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>3</td><td>Bookbuilding & Roadshow</td><td>Marketing to institutional investors to gauge demand and determine a price range.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>4</td><td>Pricing & Allocation</td><td>Final offer price is set based on demand from the bookbuilding process.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>5</td><td>Listing & Trading</td><td>Shares are listed on an exchange (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ) and public trading begins.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>6</td><td>Post-IPO Stabilization</td><td>The bank may support the price via a greenshoe option; a lock-up period prevents insider selling.</td></tr>

                </table>
            </div>
            <h4>Example – Airbnb IPO (2020)</h4>
            <p>Airbnb raised approximately $3.5 billion. Its initial price range was $44–$50, but due to high demand, it was priced at $68 per share and listed on Nasdaq under the ticker ABNB.</p>
            <h4>Key IPO Concepts</h4>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Bookbuilding:</strong> The process where investment banks collect demand indications from institutional investors to determine the final offer price.</li>
                <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> An arrangement where banks guarantee to buy any unsold shares (firm commitment) or simply sell what they can (best efforts).</li>
                <li><strong>Greenshoe Option:</strong> An overallotment option (typically 15%) that allows underwriters to sell extra shares if demand is strong and helps stabilize the price post-listing.</li>
                <li><strong>Lock-up Period:</strong> A period (typically 90–180 days) during which company insiders are not allowed to sell their shares after the IPO.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Follow-On Offerings (FPO / SEO)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A follow-on offering is when a publicly listed company issues additional shares after its IPO to raise more capital or provide liquidity for existing shareholders.</p>
            <h4>Types of Offerings</h4>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                     <thead>
                        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td><strong>Primary Offering</strong></td><td>The company issues new shares, and the proceeds go to the company (e.g., to fund expansion).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>Secondary Offering</strong></td><td>Existing shareholders (like founders or venture capitalists) sell their own shares, and the proceeds go to them.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>Mixed Offering</strong></td><td>A combination of both a primary and secondary offering.</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
             <h4>Mechanisms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block Trade:</strong> A large, pre-arranged sale of shares by an existing holder, often sold at a discount to the market price.</li>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Bookbuild (ABB):</strong> A rapid share sale (typically within 24-48 hours) that is marketed only to institutional investors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example – Tesla Follow-On (2020)</h4>
            <p>Tesla issued approximately $5 billion in new shares to fund its expansion plans. The shares were sold to investors via an accelerated bookbuild.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Private Placements & PIPEs</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Private Placement</h4>
            <p>Shares are sold directly to a select group of institutional or accredited investors without a public offering. This is faster and cheaper but the shares are usually illiquid and may be sold at a discount.</p>
            <h4>PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity)</h4>
            <p>A public company issues shares to private investors, often below the current market price, to raise capital quickly.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A biotech company raises $200 million from a group of hedge funds in a PIPE transaction to get immediate funding for its research and development pipeline.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Rights Issues & Standby Underwriting</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Rights Issue</h4>
            <p>A company offers new shares to its existing shareholders at a discount, usually in proportion to their current holdings, to protect them from dilution.</p>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Shareholders receive "rights" which they can either exercise (to buy the new shares), sell on the open market, or let expire.</p>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A company announces a 1-for-4 rights issue at $10 when the current market price is $15. This allows a shareholder to buy one new share for every four they currently hold.</p>
            <h4>Standby Underwriting</h4>
            <p>An underwriter agrees to purchase any unsubscribed shares in a rights issue, guaranteeing that the company will raise its target amount of capital.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5. SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>A SPAC is a “blank check” company formed to raise money via an IPO with the sole purpose of acquiring a private company and taking it public, typically within 18-24 months.</p>
            <h4>Lifecycle</h4>
             <ol>
                <li><strong>Formation & IPO:</strong> The SPAC raises capital from the public.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Account:</strong> The IPO proceeds are held in escrow.</li>
                <li><strong>Target Search & Merger:</strong> The SPAC finds a private company and merges with it (the "de-SPAC" transaction).</li>
                <li><strong>Public Listing:</strong> The target company becomes a publicly listed entity.</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote><strong>Why SPACs matter:</strong> They offer a faster path to the public markets compared to a traditional IPO, but are often more dilutive and face increasing regulatory scrutiny.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">6. Convertible Issuances & Hybrid ECM Products</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>These are debt or hybrid instruments that can be converted into equity. They are often used as a cheaper way for companies to raise capital.</p>
            <h4>Types</h4>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Convertible Bonds:</strong> Bonds that can be converted into a fixed number of shares at a predetermined price.</li>
                <li><strong>Mandatory Convertibles:</strong> Securities that automatically convert into shares at maturity.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity-Linked Notes:</strong> Structured products with returns tied to the performance of a company's stock.</li>
            </ul>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A company issues $500 million in convertible bonds. The bonds are convertible into shares at a price of $50 per share, while the current stock price is $40. If the stock price rises above $50, investors will likely convert their bonds into shares.</p>
