        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Securities regulators are government or quasi-government bodies responsible for overseeing securities markets, protecting investors, and ensuring fair, transparent, and efficient markets. They set the rules for public offerings, trading, disclosures, and market conduct.</p>
            <h4>Major Global Regulators</h4>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Region</th><th>Regulator</th><th>Key Responsibilities</th></tr>

                </table>
            </div>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Regulators issue licenses, review public offering filings (like an IPO prospectus), monitor trading for manipulation, and enforce rules through fines, suspensions, or delisting actions.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Elon Musk’s 2018 “funding secured” tweet led to an SEC investigation under Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) and anti-fraud laws. The outcome was a $40 million fine and stricter governance oversight for Tesla.</p>

                        <tr><td><strong>Form 8-K</strong></td><td>Event-driven</td><td>Material events like CEO changes, M&A, or major litigation.</td></tr>

        <div class="panel">

                </table>
             </div>
             <h4>Controls</h4>
            <p>Companies implement controls like insider lists, trading windows, blackout periods, and employee pre-clearance for trades. Regulators use surveillance systems to detect anomalies, with penalties including fines, disgorgement, and imprisonment.</p>
             <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Martha Stewart was convicted for insider trading in 2004 for selling her shares in ImClone Systems after receiving a non-public tip about a negative FDA decision.</p>
