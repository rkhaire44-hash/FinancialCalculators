        <button class="accordion">1. Forwards & Futures</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Forwards</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A forward is an OTC contract between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset at a pre-agreed price (the forward price) on a future date. It is fully customizable but carries counterparty credit risk as it is not centrally cleared or marked-to-market daily.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A 6-month forward on oil with a spot price of $80 and a risk-free rate of 5% would have a forward price of approximately $82.02. If the spot price at expiry is $90, the long position gains $7.98 per barrel. If the spot is $75, the long position loses $7.02 per barrel.</p>

            <h4>B. Futures</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A futures contract is a standardized forward contract traded on an exchange and cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). This eliminates counterparty risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> Standardized terms (size, expiry), exchange-traded, no counterparty risk, and requires daily margining (Initial and Variation Margin). Profits and losses are realized daily through the mark-to-market process.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You buy 1 S&P 500 futures contract at 4,500 index points (with a multiplier of $250). If the index rises to 4,520 the next day, your gain is 20 points × $250/point = $5,000, which is credited to your margin account.</p>

            <h4>Special Topics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basis:</strong> The difference between the spot price and the futures price (Basis = Spot - Futures). The basis converges to zero as the contract approaches expiry.</li>
                <li><strong>Convenience Yield:</strong> The non-monetary benefit of physically holding a commodity, which can cause futures prices to be lower than the spot price (backwardation).</li>
                <li><strong>Cheapest-to-Deliver (CTD):</strong> In bond futures, the short party can choose from a basket of eligible bonds to deliver. They will choose the one that is cheapest for them to deliver.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Options</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Vanilla Options</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A contract giving the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) an underlying asset at a specified strike price on or before a certain expiry date.</p>
            <p><strong>Example (European Call):</strong> You buy a 3-month call option on a stock with a strike price of $105 for a premium of $3. If the stock price at expiry is $120, your payoff is $120 - $105 = $15, for a net profit of $12 ($15 payoff - $3 premium). If the stock is below $105, the option expires worthless, and your loss is the $3 premium.</p>

        <button class="accordion">3. Swaps</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)</h4>
            <p>An agreement to exchange fixed-rate interest payments for floating-rate payments on a notional principal amount.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> On a $100m notional, Party A pays a fixed 3% and receives a floating rate (e.g., 3-month SOFR). Each quarter, only the net difference between the fixed and floating payments is exchanged.</p>
            
            <h4>B. FX Swaps / Forwards</h4>
            <p>An FX Forward locks in an exchange rate for a future date. An FX Swap involves a simultaneous spot and forward transaction, effectively swapping currencies now and agreeing to reverse the transaction later.</p>

            <h4>C. Total Return Swaps (TRS)</h4>
            <p>One party receives the total return (price appreciation + dividends) of a reference asset, while the other party receives a floating interest rate plus a spread. This is used to gain synthetic long exposure, often with leverage.</p>

            <h4>D. Inflation Swaps</h4>
            <p>An agreement to exchange a fixed-rate payment for a payment linked to a realized inflation rate (e.g., CPI).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Swaptions, Caps, and Floors</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Swaption</h4>
            <p>An option to enter into an interest rate swap in the future. A <strong>Payer Swaption</strong> is the right to pay a fixed rate (valuable if rates rise), and a <strong>Receiver Swaption</strong> is the right to receive a fixed rate (valuable if rates fall).</p>

            <h4>B. Caps & Floors</h4>
            <p>A <strong>Cap</strong> is a series of call options on an interest rate (caplets) that protects a borrower from rates rising above a certain level. A <strong>Floor</strong> is a series of put options (floorlets) that guarantees a minimum income for a lender.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">5. Credit Derivatives</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Credit Default Swap (CDS)</h4>
            <p>An insurance-like contract against the credit default of a reference entity. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium (the spread), and the protection seller agrees to compensate the buyer if a credit event (like a default) occurs.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> On a $10m notional with a 1.5% spread, the buyer pays $150,000 per year. If the referenced entity defaults, the seller pays the loss given default to the buyer.</p>

            <h4>B. CDS Indices</h4>
            <p>These are baskets of single-name CDSs that allow investors to trade the overall credit risk of a market segment efficiently. Examples include iTraxx (Europe) and CDX (US).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">6. Exotic & Structured Products</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Exotic Options</h4>
            <p>Options with more complex features than standard vanilla options, such as Barrier, Asian, and Lookback options.</p>
            
            <h4>B. Structured Notes</h4>
            <p>Debt instruments with embedded derivatives that create customized payoff profiles. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Principal-Protected Note:</strong> A zero-coupon bond combined with a call option to provide downside protection with upside participation.</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse Convertible:</strong> A note with a high coupon that exposes the investor to downside risk in an underlying stock (effectively selling a put option).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>C. Variance & Volatility Products</h4>
            <p>Instruments used to trade volatility itself. A <strong>Variance Swap</strong> has a payoff based on the difference between realized variance and a strike variance. <strong>VIX Futures/Options</strong> allow investors to trade the implied volatility of the S&P 500.</p>
