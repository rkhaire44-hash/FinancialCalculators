            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>An equity index is a statistical measure that tracks the performance of a basket of stocks representing a specific market, sector, or investment theme. They are used as benchmarks, underlyings for ETFs and derivatives, and indicators of market sentiment.</p>

        <button class="accordion">2. Index Construction Methodologies</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>A. Price-Weighted Index</h4>
            <p>Each stock’s weight is proportional to its share price. Higher-priced stocks have more influence, regardless of their market cap. The Dow Jones (DJIA) is a famous example.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Stock A is $100 and Stock B is $25, Stock A has 4x the weight of Stock B, even if it's a smaller company.</p>
            
            <h4>B. Market Capitalization-Weighted Index</h4>
            <p>Each stock’s weight is its market cap divided by the total market cap of all constituents. This reflects a company's economic size. The S&P 500 is a primary example.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the S&P 500, Apple and Microsoft make up a significant portion of the index's weight due to their massive market caps.</p>
            
            <h4>C. Float-Adjusted Market Cap Weighting</h4>
            <p>This is the modern standard, used by S&P, MSCI, and FTSE. It is similar to market-cap weighting but excludes restricted/non-tradable shares (e.g., insider or government holdings) to reflect the actual investable portion of the company.</p>
            
            <h4>D. Equal-Weighted Index</h4>
            <p>Every stock in the index is given the same weight (e.g., 1/500th in an equal-weighted S&P 500). This requires regular rebalancing and gives smaller companies more influence than in a market-cap index.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Index Rebalancing & Turnover</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Rebalancing is the periodic process of updating an index’s constituents and weights to ensure it continues to accurately represent its intended market segment.</p>
            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Review:</strong> The index provider reviews all eligible companies based on criteria like market cap, float, and liquidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Additions/Deletions:</strong> Companies are added or removed based on their ranking.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight Adjustment:</strong> Weights are recalculated based on new market values.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Portfolio managers and ETFs tracking the index must adjust their holdings accordingly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>When Tesla was added to the S&P 500 in December 2020, it triggered approximately $80 billion of inflows as passive funds tracking the index were forced to buy its shares to stay aligned with the new composition.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Custom & Sector Indices</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Specialized indices created to represent specific sectors, themes, or strategies. They are often used for benchmarking or as the basis for investment products like ETFs.</p>
            <h4>Types & Examples</h4>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
                    </thead>

        <button class="accordion">5. Benchmarking & Tracking Error</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Benchmarking</h4>
            <p>The process of comparing a portfolio’s performance against a relevant reference index to measure its relative return (alpha).</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a portfolio returns 10% and its benchmark (the S&P 500) returns 8%, the portfolio has generated an alpha of +2%.</p>
            
            <h4>Tracking Error</h4>
            <p>Measures how closely a portfolio or ETF tracks its benchmark. It is the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio's and the benchmark's returns.</p>
            <p><strong>Causes of Tracking Error:</strong> Fees, transaction costs, sampling instead of full replication, and cash drag (uninvested cash).</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">6. Total Return vs. Price Return Indices</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h4>Price Return Index</h4>
            <p>Reflects only the price appreciation of the constituent stocks and excludes dividends. This is the version most often quoted in daily financial news (e.g., the standard S&P 500 index value).</p>
            
            <h4>Total Return Index</h4>
            <p>Reflects both price changes and the reinvestment of all dividends paid by the constituent stocks. This represents the true, complete return an investor would receive over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Total Return = Price Return + Dividend Yield (Reinvested)</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Over a 30-year period, the S&P 500 Price Index might rise ~700%, but the S&P 500 Total Return Index could rise ~1600% due to the powerful effect of compounding reinvested dividends.</p>
