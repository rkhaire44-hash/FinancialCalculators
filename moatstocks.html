            'cams': {
                title: 'CAMS (Computer Age Management Services)',
                moat: 'Duopoly & High Switching Costs',
                reason: 'CAMS and KFintech are the only two major companies (a duopoly) allowed to act as Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTA) for almost the entire mutual fund industry. **Example:** When you invest in an HDFC, SBI, or ICICI mutual fund, CAMS handles all your data, transactions, and statements. It\'s the official record-keeper. It would be incredibly complex and expensive for a fund house to switch RTAs, creating "high switching costs".',
                sustainability: 'The moat is extremely sustainable. The mutual fund industry is growing, and CAMS grows with it. As long as SEBI\'s regulations are in place, it\'s nearly impossible for a new competitor to enter. Its future is directly tied to the growth of India\'s financial savings.'
            },
            'cdsl': {
                title: 'CDSL (Central Depository Services Ltd)',
                moat: 'Duopoly & Network Effect',
                reason: 'CDSL and NSDL are the only two companies in India that can hold your stocks, bonds, and mutual funds in electronic (demat) form. This is a government-mandated duopoly. **Example:** When you buy a stock on Zerodha or Groww, it is held safely in your name by CDSL. As more brokers (like Zerodha) choose CDSL, more investors are added to its network, making it the default choice for new brokers. This is a powerful "network effect".',
                sustainability: 'This moat is as strong as it gets. It is regulated by SEBI and is a core part of India\'s financial market. The number of demat accounts is growing rapidly, and CDSL earns a small fee on every transaction and from every company. Its growth is locked in with the growth of the Indian stock market.'
            },
            'irctc': {
                title: 'IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism)',
                moat: 'Pure Government Monopoly',
                reason: 'IRCTC has an exclusive, government-granted monopoly on all online railway ticket bookings in India. **Example:** Every time you, or anyone you know, books a train ticket on the app or website, you *must* use IRCTC\'s system. They are the only gateway and charge a convenience fee on every single ticket. They also have a monopoly on catering on trains and selling packaged water at stations.',
                sustainability: 'This is one of the strongest moats in India. As long as Indian Railways is the primary mode of transport, IRCTC\'s dominance is guaranteed by law. Its sustainability is tied to government policy, which is highly stable. It is also expanding into tourism and food catering, using its massive customer base.'
            },
            'iex': {
                title: 'IEX (Indian Energy Exchange)',
                moat: 'Monopoly (Network Effect)',
                reason: 'IEX is India\'s premier power trading exchange, with over 90% market share in the short-term electricity market. **Example:** If a state like Maharashtra needs extra electricity for a day, they buy it on IEX. If a factory has surplus power, they sell it on IEX. Because all the buyers and sellers are on IEX, it has the best price and most liquidity, which attracts *more* buyers and sellers. This is a classic "network effect".',
                sustainability: 'This moat is very strong. A new competitor (like HPX) has found it very difficult to take market share. As India\'s power needs become more complex, the need for a spot market grows. The only risk is a major, unfavorable change in government regulations, but the trend is towards *more* market-based electricity, which helps IEX.'
            },
            'mcx': {
                title: 'MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange)',
                moat: 'Monopoly (Network Effect)',
                reason: 'Similar to IEX, MCX is India\'s largest commodity derivatives exchange, with over 95% market share. **Example:** If a jeweler wants to lock in a future price for gold, or a farmer wants to hedge the price of cotton, they use MCX. Because all the commodity traders are on MCX, it has the highest liquidity, making it the only practical choice. This creates a powerful network effect.',
                sustainability: 'Very strong. This is another core piece of India\'s financial infrastructure. Its dominance is locked in. Its future growth depends on more Indians trading commodities and new commodity products (like natural gas, electricity futures) being introduced, both of which are long-term positive trends.'
            },
            'pidilite': {
                title: 'Pidilite Industries',
                moat: 'Brand Monopoly & Distribution',
                reason: 'Pidilite is the dominant player in adhesives. Its moat is its brand. **Example:** You don\'t ask for "adhesive"; you ask for "Fevicol". The brand has become the name of the product itself. This "brand monopoly" is supported by a massive distribution network that reaches tiny villages, making it impossible for competitors to match its reach.',
                sustainability: 'Extremely sustainable. This brand trust is built over generations. While new competitors can exist, they are forced to compete on price, while Pidilite enjoys premium pricing and high-profit margins. As construction and crafts grow, so does Pidilite. It has also successfully expanded into new categories like waterproofing (Dr. Fixit).'
            },
            'asianpaints': {
                title: 'Asian Paints',
                moat: 'Oligopoly (Distribution & Supply Chain)',
                reason: 'Asian Paints is the leader in the Indian paint industry (an oligopoly with Berger, Kansai Nerolac). Its moat is its supply chain. **Example:** It has a highly advanced IT system that tracks paint sales at thousands of small hardware stores. It can restock a specific color in a specific shop within hours. This efficiency and its vast dealer network are impossible for a new player to replicate.',
                sustainability: 'Very strong. The brand is trusted, and the distribution network is a massive barrier. The entry of a new, large player (like Grasim) is a potential threat, but Asian Paints\' deep relationships, data, and brand power give it a huge advantage. The "paint-as-a-service" (EzyPainting) model also locks in customers.'
            },
            'itc': {
                title: 'ITC Ltd.',
                moat: 'Legal Monopoly (Regulatory Barriers)',
                reason: 'ITC has a near-monopoly in the cigarette market in India (>75% share). This is protected by strict government regulations that ban advertising for tobacco products. **Example:** A new company *cannot* launch a new cigarette brand and advertise it on TV, print, or billboards. This makes it almost impossible to build a brand and challenge ITC, giving it a powerful regulatory moat.',
                sustainability: 'The cigarette moat is sustainable as long as the regulations are in place. The risk is that the government increases taxes so much that it hurts volumes. However, ITC is using the massive cash flow from this business to build its *new* moats in FMCG (Aashirvaad, Sunfeast) and Hotels.'
            },
            'hal': {
                title: 'Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL)',
                moat: 'Monopoly (Government Regulated)',
                reason: 'HAL is a state-owned enterprise with a strategic monopoly. It is the primary domestic supplier of aircraft, helicopters, and maintenance services to the Indian Armed Forces. **Example:** When the Indian Air Force needs to buy or service a Tejas fighter jet or a Dhruv helicopter, HAL is the only domestic company with the capability and mandate to do so. These are high-tech, strategic assets.',
                sustainability: 'Extremely high. The barrier to entry is insurmountable for a private player due to the high-tech nature, massive capital, and strategic importance (national security). As India focuses on "Make in India" for defense, HAL is the primary beneficiary. Its order book is guaranteed for decades.'
            },
            'coalindia': {
                title: 'Coal India Ltd. (CIL)',
                moat: 'Natural Monopoly (Government Mandate)',
                reason: 'CIL is a state-owned enterprise that enjoys a monopoly over coal mining in India, accounting for over 80% of production. **Example:** NTPC, India\'s largest power producer, is almost entirely dependent on Coal India for its raw material. CIL\'s control over India\'s coal reserves is its "natural monopoly".',
                sustainability: 'This moat is strong in the medium term, as India is still heavily dependent on coal for power. The long-term risk (20+ years) is the global shift to renewable energy (solar, wind). However, for the next 1-2 decades, India\'s energy needs are so large that coal will remain critical, protecting CIL\'s position.'
            },
            'crisil': {
                title: 'CRISIL Ltd.',
                moat: 'Oligopoly (Brand Trust & Regulation)',
                reason: 'The credit rating industry is an oligopoly (CRISIL, ICRA, CARE). CRISIL (an S&P Global company) is the largest and most reputed. **Example:** When a company like Tata wants to borrow ₹1,000 Cr by issuing a bond, SEBI requires it to get a "credit rating". Investors trust CRISIL\'s "AAA" rating, which allows Tata to borrow at a low-interest rate. This "trust" is the moat and takes decades to build.',
                sustainability: 'Very sustainable. Trust is the key. As India\'s corporate bond market deepens, the need for ratings will only grow. Being part of S&P Global gives it an international standard of credibility that is hard to challenge. It has also diversified into data and analytics, which is a high-growth area.'
            },
            'bse': {
                title: 'BSE Ltd.',
                moat: 'Duopoly (Market Infrastructure)',
                reason: 'BSE operates in a duopoly with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) as the only two major stock exchanges in India. **Example:** While NSE is the leader in equity trading, BSE has a monopoly in other segments, like its BSE StAR MF platform, which is India\'s largest mutual fund distribution platform. Such market infrastructure businesses have extremely high regulatory barriers.',
                sustainability: 'Very strong. You cannot just open a new stock exchange. This is a regulated duopoly. BSE\'s future growth is tied to the "financialization" of India: more people investing in stocks and mutual funds. It also earns revenue from data services and has a new, growing segment in derivatives.'
            },
            'nestle': {
                title: 'Nestlé India',
                moat: 'Brand Monopoly (in specific categories)',
                reason: 'While the FMCG sector is competitive, Nestlé enjoys a monopoly-like status in several key product categories. **Example:** It has over 95% market share in the infant nutrition space with brands like `Cerelac` and `Lactogen`. Its brand `Maggi` also holds a commanding share (over 60%) in the instant noodles market. This brand loyalty is a powerful moat.',
                sustainability: 'Extremely sustainable. Brand trust, especially in a category like baby food, is paramount. Parents will not switch brands to save a few rupees. Nestlé has held this position for decades and uses its brand power and R&D to launch new, premium products that keep its profit margins high.'
            },
            'indigo': {
                title: 'IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation)',
                moat: 'Dominant Market Share & Cost Leadership',
                reason: 'IndiGo controls over 60% of the Indian domestic aviation market. Its moat is a relentless focus on cost. **Example:** By using only one type of aircraft (Airbus A320), it saves billions on training, maintenance, and spare parts. Its quick 30-minute turnaround time means its planes are in the air (making money) more than competitors. This allows it to offer low prices and still be profitable.',
                sustainability: 'This moat is very strong. Aviation is a tough business, but IndiGo has proven it can be profitable while competitors fail. Its scale is now so large that it can dictate prices and routes. Its future is tied to India\'s growing middle class, which is increasingly choosing to fly.'
            },
            'hindustanzinc': {
                title: 'Hindustan Zinc Ltd.',
                moat: 'Natural Resource Monopoly',
                reason: 'Hindustan Zinc is India’s only integrated producer of zinc, lead, and silver, with over 75% market share in zinc. **Example:** Its moat comes from its exclusive ownership of high-quality mining assets. A competitor cannot simply decide to "start a zinc company"; they would need to find a new mine, which is almost impossible. This "natural resource" moat is very powerful.',
                sustainability: 'Highly sustainable. The company has mining licenses for decades to come. Zinc is a fundamental commodity used in galvanizing steel (making it rust-proof), which is critical for construction and infrastructure. Demand is stable and tied to economic growth. It is also one of the lowest-cost producers in the *world*.'
            },
            'concor': {
                title: 'CONCOR (Container Corporation of India)',
                moat: 'Infrastructure & Network Dominance',
                reason: 'CONCOR is the market leader in moving shipping containers by rail from ports to inland cities. **Example:** When a container arrives at a port in Mumbai, CONCOR uses its massive network of inland container depots (ICDs) and exclusive rail wagons to transport it to a factory near Delhi. This physical infrastructure, built over decades, is its moat.',
                sustainability: 'The moat is strong but facing new challenges. It was a government-owned monopoly, but the government is now allowing private players to compete. However, CONCOR still *owns* the best-located depots and has the largest network. Its future depends on how well it competes with new, aggressive private companies.'
            },
            'marico': {
                title: 'Marico Ltd.',
                moat: 'Brand Monopoly',
                reason: 'Marico has created powerful brand monopolies. **Example:** Its `Parachute` brand is synonymous with coconut oil and has an overwhelming market share, sold in iconic blue bottles. Its `Saffola` brand is a dominant force in the premium edible oil (for heart health) and oats category. This brand power leads to pricing stability and loyal customers.',
                sustainability: 'Very sustainable. Like Pidilite and Nestlé, these brands are household names. The company has a deep distribution network to get these products to millions of shops. It has also successfully used its brand trust to expand into new areas like honey, peanut butter, and plant-based foods.'
            },
            'indiamart': {
                title: 'Indiamart Intermesh',
                moat: 'Network Effect',
                reason: 'Indiamart is India\'s largest B2B (Business-to-Business) online marketplace. Its moat is a classic network effect. **Example:** A small factory making bolts in Ludhiana *must* be on Indiamart to be found by a large construction company in Bangalore. Because all the suppliers are on Indiamart, all the buyers go there. This attracts even more suppliers, creating a cycle.',
                sustainability: 'Very strong and growing. This is a "winner-take-all" market. As more of India\'s small businesses go online, Indiamart\'s platform becomes more powerful.
